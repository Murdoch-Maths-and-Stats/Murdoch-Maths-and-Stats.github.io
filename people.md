[Jocelyn Milward](http://profiles.murdoch.edu.au/myprofile/jocelyn-milward/) has been a casual tutor at Murdoch since 2006. During that time she has consistently tutored first-year maths units – mostly MAS164 and MAS182 and their Open University equivalents.

Dr Alethea Rea

[Dr Phil Schrader](http://profiles.murdoch.edu.au/myprofile/phil-schrader/) currently teaches a first-year unit on discrete maths and logic. Phil's research uses techniques from mathematical analysis to study the geometry of curves and surfaces, including what happens to them when we deform them using gradient flows, and what we can learn about their fundamental properties from these flows. Find out more on [Phil's personal webpage](http://philschrad.github.io).

[Professor Gerd Schröder-Turk](http://profiles.murdoch.edu.au/myprofile/gerd-schroeder-turk/) currently teaches a second-year calculus unit and a third-year computational modelling units in Murdoch's mathematics curriculum. Gerd's research uses computational and geometric modelling to study nanomaterials and biological materials, such as the complex 3D nanostructures that some butterflies use to create green reflections. Gerd is also a member of Murdoch University's Senate and of the National Executive of the Australian Institute of Physics. Find out more about Gerd on his [personal webpage](http://gerdschroeder-turk.org).
