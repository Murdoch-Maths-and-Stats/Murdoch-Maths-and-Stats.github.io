Maths and Stats were well represented last week at the fourth annual [Murdoch University Women in STEMM Research Symposium](https://www.murdoch.edu.au/news/articles/murdoch-celebrates-leading-women-in-stemm). Dr Farzana Jahan gave a talk about her research in spatial statistics, and Drs. Nayomi Attanayake, Annie Jessop and Wafaa Mansoor all presented their work in the poster session. Big congratulations to Nayomi (picture below) who took out the prize for best poster!
