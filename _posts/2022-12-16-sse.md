This week at Murdoch high school students from across WA visited our campus to participate in The Santos Science Experience. <!--more-->  Dr Annie Jessop and PhD Candidate Michael Hough ran an exciting workshop on butterflies and how they create their colours. Students learnt about the physics of light and how light can interfere with chitinous nanostructures (see the picture below) that grow on butterfly wings to create colour.

Incredibly, some of these nanostructures resemble complex geometries like the [Gyroid](http://gerdschroeder-turk.org/optical-materials-and-gyroid-photonics/), a triply periodic bicontinuous surface that is the focus of Annie's research (picture below).

The students gained an appreciation of how mathematics, physics, and chemistry are fundamental in understanding the many mysteries of life, including how butterflies create their colours!

Big thanks to [Wei Chong](https://www.instagram.com/certainlynotwei/) for photos of the event!
