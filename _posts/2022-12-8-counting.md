It's a basic convention established in primary school maths that when I write 1235 I mean the number one thousand two hundred and thirty five, that is, one lot of a thousand, two hundreds, three tens and five ones. Remembering that $$1000=10^3, 100=10^2, 10=10^1,$$ and $$1=10^1$$, what we are doing here is tallying powers of 10. 

This is called a base 10 number system, each of the digits in 1235 multiplies a power of 10 according to its place value. 

This is not only way we could write numbers - we could use powers of 3 instead, for example - but base 10 certainly seems like the most natural way to do it. As I tell my first year students, this is probably because we all have ten fingers. On the other... hand... computers are essentially built from switches which are either on or off, it's like they only have two fingers, and so we make them work in base 2, or *binary*. 

However, it seems this is not quite the full story. I was surprised to find out while living in Japan that not everyone counts to ten on their fingers using both hands. Japanese people typically count to ten with *one hand* by starting with an open hand, folding each finger down, and then popping them back up.

([Ancient Roman finger numerals](https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasure-roman-finger-numerals) start off the same way!)

The Chinese use hand gestures (varying slightly by region) which for the numbers 6 to 10 resemble the corresponding Chinese Characters.

There doesn't seem to be much indication that these are associated with the use of a number system in a base other than 10 (although, if you'll indulge me in some wild speculation, perhaps in ancient times there was such a system in China, see the [hexagrams of the I Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagram_(I_Ching))?).

There are other examples though where there does seem to be a connection between the method of counting and the base that is used. People in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh use the lines between segments of the fingers to count. This is done by touching each line with the thumb of the same hand, so there are 12, and if you tally these with fingers on the other hand you can count up to 60. There is a [theory](https://nrich.maths.org/6070) kicking around that the Sumerians might have used such a method, accounting for their base 60 numbers, and our clocks.

In the (recently extinct) language of the Yuki people in California the words used for numbers indicate a base 4 counting system, based on counting the spaces between fingers instead of the fingers themselves. Base 4 is also used in the language of the Kewa people of Papua New Guinea: 4 is expressed as 'one hand', 6 is 'one hand and one thumb', 15 is 'three hands and three thumbs'. 

The Yuki, Kewa, and other methods of counting, some including toes and other body parts, are described in Chapter 6 of the book [When Languages Die](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/when-languages-die-9780195372069?cc=au&lang=en&) by K. David Harrison. Another system described in the book is that of the Pomo of California, who have unique words for each number below 20, and then 20 is 'one stick', 61 is 'three sticks and one', and so on - a base 20 system. In fact, something similar happens in the French language after the number 60 - maybe the Gauls counted with their fingers and toes? Or with two hands in the Japanese style? Indeed, there is also the English word 'score' meaning 20, which is [speculated](https://www.etymonline.com/word/score) to have come from Celts counting sheep in groups of 20.

So, let me revise my assessment of why base 10 seems so natural. First: it's probably not just because we have 10 fingers, but because of *how some of us count with them*, and second: because by the time you find out things could be different, base 10 is already very, very familiar!
