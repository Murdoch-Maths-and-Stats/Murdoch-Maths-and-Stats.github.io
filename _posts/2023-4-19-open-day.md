Join Murdoch Uni's Maths&Stats group at this year's Open Day to celebrate our refreshed degrees and majors in statistics and mathematics. <!--more-->
We have just had our first (small) intake of students in the new degree in Semester 1. We are now hoping that the applied nature of our degree, the good balance of maths and stats, and the flexible second major options will make it a good choice for our students. For more info on our degree, click [here](https://www.murdoch.edu.au/course/undergraduate/mj-masc) or [here](https://www.murdoch.edu.au/news/articles/new-courses-bring-new-life-to-stem-at-murdoch-university), and see the [AMSI career guide](https://careers.amsi.org.au) for where our Maths&Stats degree could take you. 

Open Day is on Saturday 29 April. Come by to find out what we do and chat some maths and stats. You'll find us in Murdoch's brand new [Boola Katitjin building](https://maps.murdoch.edu.au/?sharepoi=136022.023) and in Bayliss Court within the [School of Mathematics, Statistics, Chemistry and Physics](https://maps.murdoch.edu.au/?sharepoi=340).

With STEM truly everywhere in today's world, Maths and Stats remains a good and fun choice.
