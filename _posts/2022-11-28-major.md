Last week Murdoch University's academic council voted to re-open our Maths and Stats degree and major. <!--more--> This is the culmination of a lot of hard work, and also the beginning of more! 
We're excited to get to work and do our part to address the national  [STEM skills shortage](https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/news-and-media/2022/07/media-release-new-report-shows-alarming-stem-skill-shortage-threatens-new), which is coinciding with a [critical shortage](https://theconversation.com/1-in-4-australian-year-8s-have-teachers-unqualified-in-maths-this-hits-disadvantaged-schools-even-harder-161100) of qualified high school maths teachers and an [all time low](https://amsi.org.au/2022/04/27/maths-crisis-year-12-maths-enrolments-reach-all-time-low/) in year 12 mathematics participation. You can find out more about our Maths and Stats major below. More to come!
